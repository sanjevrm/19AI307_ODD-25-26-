# Ex.No:3(C) ABSTRACTION

## QUESTION:
Create an abstract class Employee with method calculatePay(). Extend it to HourlyEmployee and SalariedEmployee.

Input Format:

- The first line contains an integer:
    1 → for HourlyEmployee  
    2 → for SalariedEmployee

- If input is 1 (HourlyEmployee):
    The second line contains two values:
    - hours worked (integer)
    - rate per hour (double)

- If input is 2 (SalariedEmployee):
    The second line contains one value:
    - monthly salary (double)

Output Format:

- A single line containing the calculated pay formatted to two decimal places.

## AIM:
To implement an abstract class Employee with a method calculatePay() and extend it to HourlyEmployee and SalariedEmployee to compute employee pay.


## ALGORITHM :
1. Read the employee type (1 for hourly, 2 for salaried).

2. If type is 1, read hours worked and rate per hour, then calculate pay = hours ×     rate.

3. If type is 2, read monthly salary and set pay = salary.

4. Use the respective subclass (HourlyEmployee or SalariedEmployee) to compute pay     through calculatePay().

5. Print the final pay formatted to two decimal places.

    }

    @Override
    double calculatePay() {
        return hoursWorked * ratePerHour;
    }
}

class SalariedEmployee extends Employee {
    double monthlySalary;

    SalariedEmployee(double monthlySalary) {
        this.monthlySalary = monthlySalary;
    }

    @Override

        int type = sc.nextInt();
        double pay = 0.0;

        if (type == 1) {
            int hours = sc.nextInt();
            double rate = sc.nextDouble();
            Employee e = new HourlyEmployee(hours, rate);
            pay = e.calculatePay();
        } else if (type == 2) {
            double salary = sc.nextDouble();
            Employee e = new SalariedEmployee(salary);
            pay = e.calculatePay();
